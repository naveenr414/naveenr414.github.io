title: Some Tips and Examples for Fellowship Applications
---
<!-- ========== ABOUT ========= -->
<br />
With Fellowship applications starting up, I wanted to post some examples of fellowship essays, successful and unsuccessful, along with a few tips for each. 
I applied to 6 fellowships in 2021, and 2 in 2023. 
I've posted example essays for each of fellowship below, then described some tips on thoughts on each.

<h2>Overall Tips</h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>Read through the fellowship's websites</b> - Different fellowships look for different types of candidates. 
  Typically, each fellowship's website lists the sort of criterion that they are looking for. 
  Read through these, and try to tailor your appliation toward these criterion. </li>
  <li><b>Start early and go through the drafting process</b> - Fellowships take time to complete.
  For some of the fellowships due in October, I started thinking about initial drafts in mid-late summer. 
  Starting early gives the benefit of iterating through multiple drafts; I remember for my NSF Fellowship, 
  I completely switched topics and writing style a month or so after my first draft.
  Because I had started early, I was able to have time to revise even after overhauling the writeup.</li>
  <li><b>Swap with friends and professors</b> - Sending over drafts to friends and advisors allows for different persepctives on essays. 
  For me personally, I created a spreadsheet of which fellowships to send to which friends, and trying to get different people to look at each essay. 
  Additionally, some schools have some type of fellowship advisor or contact. 
  If your school has this, then I would highly advise reaching out and having them take a look at your essay.
  These folks have the experience of looking at many essays, and are very good at condensing writing + making sure 
  only the important parts remain. </li>
  <li><b>Transfer your personal statement across applications</b> - The research statement highlights your personal research and its connection
  to your future interests. This statement is re-used across many applications, and is similar to the PhD statement of purpose. 
  By spending time initially to craft a good statement, you can re-use this statement (with minor tweaks) for each new application.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Specific Fellowships</h2>
<h3>Churchill Scholarship</h3>
<h5>Fellowship Materials</h5>
<ol>
  <li><b>Personal Statement</b> - This is a standard 2-page research statement that focuses on past experiences + future interests</li>
  <li><b>Research Proposal</b> - For research-based courses, this proposal explains the type of research you plan to carry out at Gates-Cambridge
  and its relavance to your interests. Oftentimes, they recommend contacting your potential PI beforehand to discuss what type of research 
  you might want to do. For my proposal, I focused on ways I could build upon a PI's prior work in mechanism design, and listed out 
  two different potential avenues. Note that, for some courses, the proposal isn't binding; for me, I switched advisors after I got to Cambridge,
  though this does not hold true for all situations.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Tips</h5>
<ol>
  <li>I would recommend looking through different advisors/PIs for your course/proposed program, and see which one fits you best. 
    I would recommend this before you start writing your research proposal so you have a good idea of the types of research you could perform.
  </li>
  <li>The scholarship's webiste lists that they look for "jagged edges"; in other words, they focus more on your 
    scientific/research accomplishments, than other "extra-curriculars." Because of this, I would try and focus on 
    your past research experiences in the personal statement. 
</ol>

<h3>DOE Computational Science Fellowship</h3>
<h5>Fellowship Materials</h5>
<ol>
  <li><b>Course Plan</b> - Essentially a list of potential courses you'll take in graduate school, including those in and out of your field. 
  If you don't know which school you plan on attending yet, then I would pick one school on your list and detail the courses 
  available there.</li>
  <li><b>Field of Interest</b> - What general field do you plan to work in + what are the big questions in this field</li>
  <li><b>Computational Power</b> - This essay is specific to the DOE Fellowship. For my essay, I tried to relate how AI 
  can benefit from more data, and how we can develop more efficient models. My understanding is that they look for
  the types of experiments that are enabled through large amounts of computational power.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Tips</h5>
I don't have too many tips on this fellowship. It seems that they're looking for researchers who sit at the edge 
of computation and application, such as those in bioinformatics. 
<br/>
<h3>Gates-Cambridge Scholarship</h3>
<h5>Fellowship Materials</h5>
<ol>
  <li><b>Why Gates-Cambridge?</b> - In contrast to the Churchill essay, Gates-Cambridge cares more about their applicants'
  overall profile. The essay is the space to tell a story weaving your past research, extra-curriculars, etc. and 
  where Gates-Cambridge fits in. Beyond this essay, both Churchill and Gates-Cambridge require you to fill out an application 
  to Cambridge.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Tips</h5>
<ol>
  <li>I would highly recommend reading through the criteria listed on the Gates-Cambridge website, and write your 
    essay revolving around these themes. They look for people who can accomplish each of these criteria, so I would
    think through how your past experiences can match each accomplishment. 
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Hertz Fellowship</h3>
<h5>Fellowship Materials</h5>
<ol>
  <li><b>Hobbies and Interests</b> - This seems to be the most unique and important essay for Hertz. 
  I interpreted this to mean that they're looking for the types of interesting/creative things that you 
  pursue outside of research. At first, I had a hard time coming up with any one hobby, so I decided to 
  talk instead about a variety of hobbies and their connections.</li>
  <li><b>How is it science/engineering</b> - I always thought that this essay was a weird one. For a lot of what
  I work on, it's clear that it an application of science and engineering, so I wasn't sure what to write. 
  I tried to discuss how computer science/machine learning combines elements of both science and engineering, 
  and tried to discuss this here.</li>
  <li><b>Why Graduate School</b> - This one is similar to the last paragraph of a PhD statement of purpose. 
  In my essays, I tried to not only discuss the research fit, but also the types of connections or opportunities
  available in a particular unviersity or city.</li>
  <li><b>Research Statement</b> - Fairly straightforward discussion of the type of research you're interested 
  in pursuing in the future.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Tips</h5>
<ol>
  <li>The hobbies and interests essay seems to be the most important, so I would spend some time on that. 
  The goal with that essay is to try to portray your personality, so I would talk about any activity that reveals
  other parts of you. 
  </li>
  <li>After the initial screening phase, there are two interview-based stages before the Fellowship is awarded. 
    These interviews are with super smart experts in your field. 
    They last about an hour, and ask in-depth questions about topics in your field. 
    I would recommend brushing up on the fundementals, and specifically for computer science, it can be helpful
    brushing up on algorithms questions and similar brain teasters. 
    For my interviews, I was asked about matching algorithms and Markov chains (where I forgot how to compute 
    eigenvectors during the interview); I've attached some notes from my interview here: [<a href={{ "/assets/sop/hertz_notes.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl}}>notes</a>]. 
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>NDSEEG Fellowship</h3>
<h5>Fellowship Materials</h5>
<ol>
  <li><b>Research Proposal</b> - The goal here is to propose some research that is well-aligned with the 
  Department of Defense's interests. You'll be judged on how well you can explain the connection between your research 
  and the needs of the Department of Defense.</li>
  <li><b>Personal Statement</b> - Fairly routine persoanl statement, with the only caveat being that they require
  all persoanlly identifiable information to be redacted or removed.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Tips</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Read through the DoD's BAA announcement and try to find the section which best aligns with your research.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>NSF GRFP</h3>
<h5>Fellowship Materials</h5>
<ol>
  <li><b>Research Proposal</b> - Note that the research is non-binding for NSF; they typically aim to award a person
  rather than a particular project, so the goal is to see whether you're capable of performing good future research.
  In your research proposal, you should specify both the intellectual merits, which is the connection to other fields, 
  and the broader impacts, which is how your research can have an impact in the real-world. Even better if you can relate this 
  to your prior work. </li> 
  <li><b>Personal Statement</b>- Lists out the previous research you've done along with any outreach and other activites 
  which belong broadly in the category of broader impacts. </li> 
</ol>
<h5>Tips</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Focus and discuss your broader impacts for both the research proposal and personal statement. 
  For the research proposal, broader impacts include connections to other applications, while for the 
  personal statement, broader impacts include ways you can perform outreach or have an impact beyond research.
  </li>
  <li>Try to find a topic you're knowledgeable about for the research proposal so you can discuss the contributions 
  in-depth. Because the research proposal is non-binding, you can discuss your research in-depth even if you 
  never end up pursuing it.  
  </li>
  <li>Make sure your formatting is correct; I've heard of situations where applications get rejected 
  for even small formatting mistakes. 
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship</h3>
<h5>Fellowship Materials</h5>
<ol>
  <li><b>New American Essay</b> - This is probably the most interesting (and also difficult) essay that I 
  had to write. The essay asks you to relate your past experiences as a "new American" (which includes 1st and 2nd
  generation Americans I think) to your development and the way you see your world. If you can relate this to 
  the type of work you pursue, that's even better.</li>
  <li><b>Personal Statement</b> - The PD Soros Fellowship looks for people outside of just research. Because of this, 
  I would discuss both your research interests, and anything else that you pursue outside of research, especialy
  if the two are related. I remember at a PD Soros informational session, I met people who talked about their research 
  and their music passions.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Tips</h5>
<ol>
  <li>For the New American essay, I would definitely recommend talking to your family members to understand 
  their past + your upbringing, and any stories that might be interesting to unearth. The New American essay is 
  very personal, so I would spend time trying to think through your past. 
  </li>
  <li>For the personal statement, I would think about yourself holistically; consider both the research you pursue, 
    and any activties outside of research.
  </li>
</ol>
